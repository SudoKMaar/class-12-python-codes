Hello,
How are you doing today? This is Barnes Beckwith. I saw your contact at the University of California, Berkeley, Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures under the Directory's portal. I seek a private beginner's language tutor for my Daughter. I would like to know if you have a STUDENT/TUTOR available for the job.
As you will be unable to teach her owing to your BUSY SCHEDULE/STATUS, you can RECOMMEND one of your STUDENT(s) who is capable of teaching.
Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, the teaching could be done remotely. This depends on the tutor's directive.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Barnes.
